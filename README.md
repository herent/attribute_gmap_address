Attribute Google Map
====================

A concrete5.8 attribute you can use to add geolocation to pages and other objects.

This attribute is very much a work in progress, but is functional to use. See the issues tracker for known bugs. Help is always appreciated, I'd like this to work for as many people as possible.
